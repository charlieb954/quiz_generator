# quiz_generator

A Python script that pulls a number of questions from the free open trivia database. 

A customised quiz can be created where:
- The user picks a category and the number of questions required
- Each question to printed to the user to decide whether to add it to the final quiz sheet by pressing 'y' or 'n'
- quiz.txt (questions without answers) and quiz_answer.txt (questions and answers) files are created

Or, a random quiz can be created where:
- The user picks the number of questions required
- A category is picked at random and the quiz is generated
- quiz.txt (questions without answers) and quiz_answer.txt (questions and answers) files are created
